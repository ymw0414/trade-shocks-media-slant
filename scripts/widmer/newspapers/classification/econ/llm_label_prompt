You are classifying newspaper articles.

Each article below is the cleaned body text of a newspaper article.
The text has been lowercased, stopwords removed, and stemmed.

For each article, decide whether it is primarily about economic activity.

Definition:
- ECON: The article is mainly about economic activity, business conditions, labor markets, production, employment, wages, prices, or related economic topics.
- NON_ECON: The article is mainly about non-economic topics such as crime, accidents, sports, weather, human interest, or politics without a clear economic focus.
- AMBIGUOUS: The article does not clearly fall into either category.
